    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <p>
      This site is a resident-led effort to make Jackson Township government easier to understand. It collects
      publicly available information, organizes it in one place, and explains key topics—like compensation,
      legal responsibilities, and elections—in plain language.
    </p>

  <section id="mission">
    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>
      The mission of this project is simple:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Help residents understand <strong>who does what</strong> in township government.</li>
      <li>Show <strong>how much officials are paid</strong> and how that has changed over time.</li>
      <li>Highlight <strong>key legal duties and requirements</strong> under Indiana Code.</li>
      <li>Equip any interested resident to <strong>run for office</strong> or ask informed questions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small">
      Transparency is not about attacking individuals. It is about giving voters and taxpayers clear,
      objective information so they can make their own decisions.
    </p>

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Indiana Gateway public finance and compensation reports.</li>
