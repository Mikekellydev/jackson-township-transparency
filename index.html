      <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        This site provides a clear, factual summary of how Jackson Township’s trustee, advisory board,
        and deputy/clerk positions have been compensated from <strong>2012 through 2024</strong>, and how leadership seats
        have changed over that time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is simple: give township residents, including our HOA and other neighborhoods, easy access
        to the same information that appears in state reports so we can be informed and prepared for the
        <strong>2026 township election</strong>.

  <h2>7. The Deputy Trustee/Clerk Role: What Changed and Why It Matters</h2>

  <p>
    From 2012 through 2014, Jackson Township employed a paid Deputy Trustee/Clerk whose duties included helping
    with township assistance records, administrative support, and maintaining public documents. According to the
    state compensation reports, this position received:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>2012: $3,500</li>
    <li>2013: $3,850</li>
    <li>2014: $4,000</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Beginning in 2015, the year a new trustee (Audra Wilcoxson) took office, the Deputy Trustee/Clerk position no
    longer appears in the township’s certified state reports. No compensation has been reported for this role from
    2015 through 2024.
  </p>

  <h3>Why this is important for transparency</h3>

  <p>
    Indiana law requires townships to maintain certain public records, respond to public requests, and document
    meeting minutes, budgets, and assistance decisions. Many townships use a deputy or clerk position to support
    those responsibilities and to provide continuity if the trustee is unavailable.
  </p>

  <p>
    The removal of this position does not necessarily indicate wrongdoing, but it does raise important questions
    for residents about administrative capacity and transparency. Without a deputy-level role:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Record-keeping and public access may depend solely on one individual.</li>
    <li>Response times for assistance, inquiries, or documents may be slower.</li>
    <li>There may be no designated “chief deputy,” which is normally expected for continuity.</li>
    <li>Critical functions like minutes, township assistance files, and budgeting support have no publicly
        compensated support role.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Questions residents may wish to explore</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Why was the deputy/clerk role discontinued after 2014?</li>
    <li>Who now performs the administrative duties formerly supported by that position?</li>
    <li>Has the township designated a chief deputy for continuity, as recommended in state guidance?</li>
    <li>Would reinstating a part-time deputy or clerk improve transparency and service to residents?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This site highlights the change simply because it affects transparency, public access, and the overall capacity
    of township operations. Understanding how these duties are handled today helps residents make informed
    decisions in upcoming township elections.

    <!-- GOVERNING SEATS / STRUCTURE -->
    <section id="governance">
      <h2>4. Governing Seats and Leadership Changes</h2>

      <p>
        Indiana law sets the structure for each township:
        <strong>1 elected trustee</strong> and <strong>3 elected advisory board members</strong>.
        From 2012–2024, Jackson Township appears to have kept that structure, with changes in
        <em>who</em> occupies those seats rather than the number of seats.
      </p>

      <h3>2012–2014</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Trustee:</strong> Jeffrey W. Cook</li>
        <li><strong>Board:</strong> Bryan Grogg · Cynthia A. Schlaifer · Ralph A. Seiler</li>
        <li><strong>Deputy/Clerk:</strong> Chlora Smith</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        Stable team with funded deputy/clerk support. All four core roles show compensation.
      </p>

      <h3>2015–2018 (Transition Term)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Trustee:</strong> Audra J. Wilcoxson replaces Jeff Cook as trustee in 2015</li>
        <li><strong>Board (various years):</strong> Jeff Cook (as board member), Troy Jester, Larry Seiler, and Cynthia Schlaifer</li>
        <li><strong>Deputy/Clerk:</strong> No compensation reported after 2014</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        This term shows a major leadership transition: new trustee, shifting board membership, and the disappearance
        of paid deputy/clerk compensation.
      </p>

      <h3>2019–2022 (Consolidation Term)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Trustee:</strong> Audra J. Wilcoxson continues</li>
        <li><strong>Board:</strong> Jeff Cook · Larry Seiler · James (Jim) Pfefferkorn</li>
        <li><strong>Compensation:</strong> Board member pay increases to $700 per member per year starting in 2020;
          trustee pay holds at $9,000 per year.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        From 2019 onward, the same trustee and the same three board members appear consistently in the state reports.
        This provides stability and continuity, but also means the same group has controlled budget oversight for multiple terms.
      </p>

      <h3>2023–2024 (Current Term in Progress)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Trustee:</strong> Audra J. Wilcoxson</li>
        <li><strong>Board:</strong> Jeff Cook · Larry Seiler · Jim Pfefferkorn</li>
        <li><strong>Compensation:</strong> Trustee $9,000 · Board $700 each</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        <h2></h2><strong>By the 2026 election, this same four-person leadership team will have served together for eight consecutive years!</strong></h2>

    </section>

    <!-- Meeting Minutes -->
    <section id="meeting-minutes-status">
  <h2>7. Meeting Minutes Status</h2>
  <p>
    Township board and advisory board meeting minutes are required public records under Indiana law
    and must be retained permanently. As of now, Jackson Township does not publish these minutes
    online, and this site does not yet have copies.
  </p>
  <p>
    An official Access to Public Records Act (APRA) request for all minutes from 2012 to the present
    will be submitted. Once those records are received, this section will be updated with
    term-by-term summaries of key actions and decisions.
  </p>
  <p class="small">
    Residents who wish to independently request minutes may also contact the township trustee or the
    DeKalb County Clerk and reference Indiana’s Open Door Law and Access to Public Records Act.

      <p>
        This site does not endorse any candidate. It simply lays out the facts so voters can decide whether they prefer
        continuity, change, or some balance of both in township leadership.

    <section id="faq">
  <h2>6. Frequently Asked Questions About This Data</h2>

  <h3>Where did these numbers come from?</h3>
  <p>
    All figures come from the State of Indiana’s <strong>Indiana Gateway</strong> “Certified Report of Public Employment
    and Compensation” for Jackson Township, DeKalb County, for the years 2012 through 2024. The data is entered and
    certified by local officials and then published by the state.
  </p>

  <h3>Are these amounts exact?</h3>
  <p>
    The numbers shown are exactly what appears in the state reports for each year and each person. They reflect
    compensation reported to the state for that calendar year. If a correction is made in Gateway in the future, this
    site can be updated to match.
  </p>

  <h3>Does this include benefits?</h3>
  <p>
    The report focuses on compensation paid, such as salary or stipend. It does not break out benefits like health
    insurance separately for township officials. For more detailed breakdowns, residents can request additional
    documentation directly from the township or the DeKalb County Clerk.
  </p>

  <h3>Why is there no deputy or clerk listed after 2014?</h3>
  <p>
    From 2012–2014, the reports show compensation for a deputy trustee/clerk. After 2014, no deputy or clerk
    compensation is reported in the state data for Jackson Township. This could mean the duties were combined into
    other roles, handled differently, or not compensated in the same way. For a precise explanation, residents can ask
    the trustee directly.
  </p>

  <h3>Is this site supporting or opposing any candidate?</h3>
  <p>
    No. This site does not endorse or oppose any person. It is simply a summary of public information already on file
    with the State of Indiana, presented in a format that is easier for residents, HOAs, and voters to understand and
    discuss.
  </p>

  <h3>What if I think there is an error?</h3>
  <p>
    The first step is to check the original Indiana Gateway report for the year in question. If there appears to be a
    mistake in the state data, residents can contact the township trustee or the DeKalb County Clerk to ask whether a
    correction is needed. If the state data changes, this site can be updated to reflect the corrected information.
