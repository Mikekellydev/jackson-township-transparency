    <h2>Trustee Designee Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>Does Jackson Township publish the trustee’s designee?</h3>
    <p>
      No published record is currently available on the township website. This does not mean the trustee failed
      to designate someone; the law requires notification to the Board Chair and the County Sheriff, not public
      posting.
    </p>

    <h3>Who would run the township if the trustee is absent or incapacitated?</h3>
    <p>
      Indiana law requires a designated individual to perform the trustee’s duties. Without public documentation,
      residents cannot verify who that person is. A simple public posting would remove uncertainty.
    </p>

    <h3>Why does the township no longer have a Deputy Trustee/Clerk?</h3>
    <p>
      Compensation data shows the position was active before 2015, then discontinued. The township may still have designated someone as required by law, but that person’s role and responsibilities are not publicly documented.
    </p>

    <h3>Is the Board Chair automatically the trustee’s backup?</h3>
    <p>
      No. The trustee must formally designate a person. The Board Chair only receives notice, not automatic
      authority.
    </p>

    <h3>Why is long-term leadership relevant?</h3>
    <p>
      Jackson Township has had a small, largely unchanged leadership group for more than a decade. Transparency
      helps residents understand how representation and oversight have evolved.
    </p>

    <h3>Is this political?</h3>
    <p>
      No. These questions focus on compliance, continuity, and public access to information. Transparency benefits
      residents regardless of who holds office.
