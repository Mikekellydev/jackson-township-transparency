    <section id="intro">
      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        This site provides a clear, factual summary of how Jackson Township’s trustee, advisory board,
        and deputy/clerk positions have been compensated from <strong>2012 through 2024</strong>, and how leadership seats
        have changed over that time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is simple: give township residents, including our HOA and other neighborhoods, easy access
        to the same information that appears in state reports so we can be informed and prepared for the
        <strong>2026 township election</strong>.

    <section id="deputy-role">
  <h2>The Deputy Trustee/Clerk Role: What Changed and Why It Matters</h2>

  <p>
    From 2012 through 2014, Jackson Township employed a paid Deputy Trustee/Clerk whose duties included helping
    with township assistance records, administrative support, and maintaining public documents. According to the
    state compensation reports, this position received:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>2012: $3,500</li>
    <li>2013: $3,850</li>
    <li>2014: $4,000</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Beginning in 2015, the year a new trustee (Audra Wilcoxson) took office, the Deputy Trustee/Clerk position no
    longer appears in the township’s certified state reports. No compensation has been reported for this role from
    2015 through 2024.
  </p>

  <h3>Why this is important for transparency</h3>

  <p>
    Indiana law requires townships to maintain certain public records, respond to public requests, and document
    meeting minutes, budgets, and assistance decisions. Many townships use a deputy or clerk position to support
    those responsibilities and to provide continuity if the trustee is unavailable.
  </p>

  <p>
    The removal of this position does not necessarily indicate wrongdoing, but it does raise important questions
    for residents about administrative capacity and transparency. Without a deputy-level role:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Record-keeping and public access may depend solely on one individual.</li>
    <li>Response times for assistance, inquiries, or documents may be slower.</li>
    <li>There may be no designated “chief deputy,” which is normally expected for continuity.</li>
    <li>Critical functions like minutes, township assistance files, and budgeting support have no publicly
        compensated support role.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Questions residents may wish to explore</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Why was the deputy/clerk role discontinued after 2014?</li>
    <li>Who now performs the administrative duties formerly supported by that position?</li>
    <li>Has the township designated a chief deputy for continuity, as recommended in state guidance?</li>
    <li>Would reinstating a part-time deputy or clerk improve transparency and service to residents?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This site highlights the change simply because it affects transparency, public access, and the overall capacity
    of township operations. Understanding how these duties are handled today helps residents make informed
    decisions in upcoming township elections.

  <h2>Before and After the Deputy Trustee/Clerk Position</h2>

  <p>
    The table below compares Jackson Township’s structure when a Deputy Trustee/Clerk was funded
    (2012–2014) with the years after that position no longer appears in the public compensation reports
    (2015–2024). This is not intended as criticism of any person, but as a simple look at how the
    township’s administrative capacity has changed.
  </p>

  <div class="comparison-grid">
    <div class="comparison-column">
      <h3>2012–2014<br><span>With Deputy Trustee/Clerk</span></h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Staffing:</strong> Trustee, three board members, and a paid Deputy Trustee/Clerk.</li>
        <li><strong>Admin support:</strong> Day to day paperwork and records supported by a dedicated
            deputy/clerk position.</li>
        <li><strong>Public records:</strong> An additional role in place to help manage minutes, files,
            and township assistance documentation.</li>
        <li><strong>Continuity:</strong> Easier to identify a deputy-level person who can assist if the
            trustee is unavailable.</li>
        <li><strong>Estimated annual cost:</strong> Approximately $3,500–$4,000 per year for the
            deputy/clerk position, based on state reports.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="comparison-column">
      <h3>2015–2024<br><span>No Deputy Position Reported</span></h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Staffing:</strong> Trustee and three board members, with no deputy/clerk listed in
            state compensation reports.</li>
        <li><strong>Admin support:</strong> Administrative duties handled by the trustee and/or others;
            no separate paid deputy role shown in the data.</li>
        <li><strong>Public records:</strong> Records and responses to requests may depend on fewer people,
            which can work well or become a strain depending on workload.</li>
        <li><strong>Continuity:</strong> From public information alone, it is less clear who would act as
            a chief deputy if the trustee could not serve.</li>
        <li><strong>Estimated annual cost:</strong> No separate deputy/clerk salary, which reduces direct
            personnel costs but may also reduce dedicated administrative capacity.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="small">
    Residents can decide for themselves whether the township’s current structure provides enough support
    for record-keeping, public access, and continuity, or whether reinstating a deputy or clerk position
    would be a worthwhile investment.
  </p>
</section>

    <section id="trustee-designee">
  <h2>10. Trustee Designee Requirement (IC 36-6-4-18)</h2>

  <p>
    Indiana law requires every township trustee to designate a person who will perform the trustee’s
    duties if the trustee becomes absent from the township or is incapacitated. This designee must be
    named within thirty days of the trustee taking office, and the trustee is required to notify:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The Chairman of the Township Board</li>
    <li>The County Sheriff</li>
    <li>Any other persons the trustee chooses</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The law does <strong>not</strong> say that the board chairman automatically becomes the designee. The
    trustee must formally designate someone and must provide official notice. Without this designation,
    the township’s continuity of operations becomes unclear.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since the Deputy Trustee/Clerk position has not been funded since 2014, it is not evident from public
    information who the legally required designee is, or whether the required notifications have been
    provided. Residents may wish to ask for clarification so they understand who would perform the
    trustee’s duties in an emergency or unexpected absence.
  </p>

  <p class="small">
    This information is provided for transparency purposes only and does not imply any criticism of current
    or past officials. Continuity of government is an important requirement under Indiana law, and having
    clarity benefits all residents.

      </ul>
      <p>
        Combined, this represents <strong>12+ consecutive years</strong> of direct influence on township budgets,

        This would be at least <strong>14 years</strong> as trustee, overseeing budgets, township assistance,

      <h2>Governing Seats and Leadership Changes</h2>

      <p>
        Indiana law sets the structure for each township:
        <strong>1 elected trustee</strong> and <strong>3 elected advisory board members</strong>.
        From 2012–2024, Jackson Township appears to have kept that structure, with changes in
        <em>who</em> occupies those seats rather than the number of seats.
      </p>

      <h3>2012–2014</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Trustee:</strong> Jeffrey W. Cook</li>
        <li><strong>Board:</strong> Bryan Grogg · Cynthia A. Schlaifer · Ralph A. Seiler</li>
        <li><strong>Deputy/Clerk:</strong> Chlora Smith</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        Stable team with funded deputy/clerk support. All four core roles show compensation.
      </p>

      <h3>2015–2018 (Transition Term)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Trustee:</strong> Audra J. Wilcoxson replaces Jeff Cook as trustee in 2015</li>
        <li><strong>Board (various years):</strong> Jeff Cook (as board member), Troy Jester, Larry Seiler, and Cynthia Schlaifer</li>
        <li><strong>Deputy/Clerk:</strong> No compensation reported after 2014</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        This term shows a major leadership transition: new trustee, shifting board membership, and the disappearance
        of paid deputy/clerk compensation.
      </p>

      <h3>2019–2022 (Consolidation Term)</h3>
      <ul>

        <li><strong>Board:</strong> Jeff Cook · Larry Seiler · James (Jim) Pfefferkorn</li>
        <li><strong>Compensation:</strong> Board member pay increases to $700 per member per year starting in 2020;
          trustee pay holds at $9,000 per year.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        From 2019 onward, the same trustee and the same three board members appear consistently in the state reports.
        This provides stability and continuity, but also means the same group has controlled budget oversight for multiple terms.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About This Data</h2>

  <h3>Where did these numbers come from?</h3>
  <p>
    All figures come from the State of Indiana’s <strong>Indiana Gateway</strong> “Certified Report of Public Employment
    and Compensation” for Jackson Township, DeKalb County, for the years 2012 through 2024. The data is entered and
    certified by local officials and then published by the state.
  </p>

  <h3>Are these amounts exact?</h3>
  <p>
    The numbers shown are exactly what appears in the state reports for each year and each person. They reflect
    compensation reported to the state for that calendar year. If a correction is made in Gateway in the future, this
    site can be updated to match.
  </p>

  <h3>Does this include benefits?</h3>
  <p>
    The report focuses on compensation paid, such as salary or stipend. It does not break out benefits like health
    insurance separately for township officials. For more detailed breakdowns, residents can request additional
    documentation directly from the township or the DeKalb County Clerk.
  </p>

  <h3>Why is there no deputy or clerk listed after 2014?</h3>
  <p>
    From 2012–2014, the reports show compensation for a deputy trustee/clerk. After 2014, no deputy or clerk
    compensation is reported in the state data for Jackson Township. This could mean the duties were combined into
    other roles, handled differently, or not compensated in the same way. For a precise explanation, residents can ask
    the trustee directly.
  </p>

  <h3>Is this site supporting or opposing any candidate?</h3>
  <p>
    No. This site does not endorse or oppose any person. It is simply a summary of public information already on file
    with the State of Indiana, presented in a format that is easier for residents, HOAs, and voters to understand and
    discuss.
  </p>

  <h3>What if I think there is an error?</h3>
  <p>
    The first step is to check the original Indiana Gateway report for the year in question. If there appears to be a
    mistake in the state data, residents can contact the township trustee or the DeKalb County Clerk to ask whether a
    correction is needed. If the state data changes, this site can be updated to reflect the corrected information.
