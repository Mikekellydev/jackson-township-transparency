      <h2>1. Offices You Can Run For</h2>
      <p>
        Jackson Township has two elected township offices at the local level:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Township Trustee</strong>  
          Oversees the township budget, township assistance, contracts, and day to day operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Township Advisory Board</strong>  
          Three member board that reviews and approves the budget, tax levies, and certain contracts and serves
          as the legislative body of the township.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Both offices are elected to four year terms. They appear on the ballot in the general election in midterm
        years such as 2018, 2022, and 2026.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Basic Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        General expectations to run for township office in Indiana include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>United States citizenship</li>
        <li>Residence in Jackson Township</li>
        <li>Voter registration at your township address</li>

      <h2>3. Paths to Get on the Ballot</h2>
      <p>
        In practice, there are three main ways a person can take office as trustee or as a member of the township
        advisory board.
      </p>

      <h3>3.1 Run in the Primary Election</h3>
      <p>
        This is the most common path. You choose a party, usually Republican or Democrat, and file a declaration
        of candidacy with the DeKalb County Clerk during the candidate filing window before the primary election.
        If you win the primary, your name appears on the general election ballot in November.
      </p>

      <h3>3.2 Run as an Independent or Minor Party Candidate</h3>
      <p>
        Independent or minor party candidates typically file a different set of forms and must collect signatures
        from a required number of voters. If the paperwork is accepted, the candidate appears on the general
        election ballot without running in a primary.
      </p>

      <h3>3.3 Fill a Vacancy by Party Caucus</h3>
      <p>
        If the trustee or a board member resigns or a seat becomes vacant before the end of a term, the political
        party that last held the seat may hold a caucus. Precinct committee members of that party meet and vote
        to select a replacement. The person chosen then serves out the remainder of the term.

      <h2>4. Practical Steps for Jackson Township Residents</h2>
      <p>
        If you live in Jackson Township and are seriously considering a run for township trustee or advisory board,
        these are practical steps to get started.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Contact the DeKalb County Clerk</strong>  
          Ask for current information on:
          <ul>
            <li>Filing windows and deadlines for township offices</li>
            <li>Required forms for party and independent candidates</li>
            <li>Any campaign finance reporting requirements</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Decide whether you will run in a party primary or as an independent</strong>  
          In many Indiana townships, most candidates file in a party primary. Independent runs are possible
          but often require more signature work.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Attend township meetings</strong>  
          Regularly attend township board meetings. Listen to how money is budgeted and how decisions are made.
          This helps you learn and also introduces you to the community as someone who is engaged.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clarify your message</strong>  
          Be ready to explain why you want to serve, how you view stewardship of township funds, and how you will
          communicate with residents and neighborhoods such as HOAs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Build a small support team</strong>  
          Even local campaigns benefit from a few trusted people who will help with paperwork, conversations with
          neighbors, and encouragement.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>5. What Township Officials Actually Do</h2>
      <p>
        Before running for office, it is important to understand the practical responsibilities.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Trustee</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Prepares the township budget and submits it for approval</li>
            <li>Administers township assistance and related social support programs where applicable</li>
            <li>Oversees township property and certain contracts such as fire protection agreements</li>
            <li>Maintains required records and reports for state and county authorities</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Advisory Board</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Reviews and approves the annual budget and tax rates</li>
            <li>Advises the trustee on financial and policy matters</li>
            <li>Acts as the township legislative body for certain decisions set by state law</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Both roles are part time and are meant to serve neighbors, not replace a full time job. Pay is set through
        the township budget and is reported in the same Indiana Gateway data that powers the transparency charts
        on the main page of this site.

      <p>
        This guide is intended for anyone who wants to serve the township with integrity, regardless of party.
        Healthy township government needs people who:

        <li>Use tax dollars carefully and transparently</li>
        <li>Listen to residents and neighborhoods</li>
        <li>Are willing to ask hard questions respectfully</li>
        <li>See these roles as service to neighbors, not a personal platform</li>
      </ul>
