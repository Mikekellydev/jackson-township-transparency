    <h1>Compensation & 12-Year Trends</h1>
    <p>
      This page summarizes publicly reported compensation for the Jackson Township Trustee and Advisory
      Board members over a 12-year period. The goal is not to criticize any individual, but to give residents
      a clear view of how elected officials have been paid over time.

    <h2>High-Level Trends (2012–2024)</h2>

    <div class="comparison-grid">
      <div class="comparison-column">
        <h3>Trustee Compensation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>2012–2014: Trustee pay reported in the mid-$4,000 range per year.</li>
          <li>2015–2018: Compensation increased to just over $10,000 per year.</li>
          <li>2019–2024: Compensation has been reported at $9,000 per year.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small">
          Trustee compensation more than doubled mid-decade and has remained stable at $9,000 for the most
          recent six years of data.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="comparison-column">
        <h3>Advisory Board Compensation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Early years (2012–2014): Board members generally received $500–$600 per year.</li>
          <li>Recent years (2019–2024): Board compensation has typically been $600–$700 per member per year.</li>
          <li>All current board members are paid the same annual amount in a given year.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small">
          Board pay has risen gradually but remains modest compared to the Trustee’s compensation.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="structure-changes">
    <h2>Changes in Structure Over Time</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2012–2014: A Deputy Trustee/Clerk position was funded and paid each year.</li>
      <li>2015 onward: The Deputy/Clerk position no longer appears in the public compensation reports.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small">
      The removal of a paid deputy or clerk does not necessarily mean those duties disappeared, but it does
      change how administrative work and continuity are handled, and is one reason this project highlights
      staffing and structure in addition to pay.
    </p>

  <section id="questions-to-consider">
    <h2>Questions Residents May Want to Consider</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Are current compensation levels appropriate for the responsibilities described on the
          <a href="roles.html">Trustee & Board Duties</a> page?</li>
      <li>Does the township’s pay structure support accountability, responsiveness, and good record-keeping?</li>
      <li>Have significant changes in pay been clearly explained to residents at the time they occurred?</li>
      <li>Should future candidates commit to publishing clear annual summaries of pay and workload?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small">
      These questions are meant to support informed voting and constructive conversation, not to target
      any particular individual.
