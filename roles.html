    <h1>Township Trustee and Advisory Board Responsibilities</h1>
    <p>
      This page summarizes the legally defined responsibilities of the Township Trustee and the Township Advisory
      Board as outlined in various sections of the Indiana Code. It is written for residents seeking a clear,
      accessible understanding of how township government functions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="trustee-responsibilities" class="card">
    <h2>Township Trustee Responsibilities</h2>

    <p><strong>Primary Executive Officer</strong><br />
      The Trustee is essentially the “CEO” of the township, responsible for executing township functions on
      behalf of residents.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Duties Under Indiana Law (Plain-Language Summary)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Township Assistance (Poor Relief)</strong><br />

      </li>
      <li><strong>Accounting and Financial Reporting</strong><br />
        Maintain financial records, pay township obligations, and file required annual reports with state
        authorities.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Fire Protection Contracts</strong><br />
        Negotiate and execute contracts for fire protection and related emergency services for township residents.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Township Property and Facilities</strong><br />
        Maintain township property, including cemeteries and any township-owned buildings or facilities.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Township Employees</strong><br />
        Hire, supervise, and compensate township employees within budgeted appropriations.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Trustee’s Designee Requirement</strong><br />
        Within thirty days of taking office, designate an individual who will perform the trustee’s duties if

      </li>
      <li><strong>Emergency Cooperation</strong><br />
        Work with county emergency management and other agencies during disasters or major incidents.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="board-responsibilities" class="card">
    <h2>Township Advisory Board Responsibilities</h2>

    <p><strong>Fiscal and Oversight Role</strong><br />
      The Advisory Board serves as the township’s legislative and fiscal oversight body. It does not manage
      day-to-day operations, but it reviews and approves how public funds are planned and spent.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Duties (Plain-Language Summary)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Budget Review and Approval</strong><br />
        Review, adjust if needed, and adopt the annual township budget prepared by the trustee.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Appropriations and Transfers</strong><br />
        Approve additional appropriations, transfers between funds, and certain financial adjustments.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Financial Oversight</strong><br />
        Examine claims and financial reports and provide a check on township spending.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Township Assistance Guidelines</strong><br />
        Adopt the township assistance standards proposed by the trustee.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Compensation Decisions</strong><br />
        Set compensation for the trustee, employees, and board members, within legal limits.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Participation in Filling Vacancies</strong><br />
        Take part in statutory processes for filling vacancies if the trustee’s office becomes vacant.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="deputy-role" class="card">
    <h2>Deputy Trustee/Clerk Role Over Time</h2>

    <p>
      From 2012 through 2014, Jackson Township employed a paid Deputy Trustee/Clerk whose duties included helping
      with township assistance records, administrative support, and maintaining public documents. According to
      state compensation reports, this position received approximately:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>2012: $3,500</li>
      <li>2013: $3,850</li>
      <li>2014: $4,000</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Beginning in 2015, the year a new trustee took office, the Deputy Trustee/Clerk position no longer appears
      in the township’s certified state reports. No compensation has been reported for this role from 2015 onward.
    </p>

    <h3>Why This Matters for Transparency</h3>
    <p>
      Indiana townships must maintain public records, respond to requests, and document minutes, budgets, and
      assistance decisions. Many townships use a deputy or clerk position to support those responsibilities and
      to provide continuity if the trustee is unavailable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Removing a funded deputy or clerk does not necessarily mean duties are being neglected, but it does affect
      how administrative work and continuity are handled. Residents may reasonably ask how those functions are
      currently being supported.
    </p>

  <section id="deputy-comparison" class="card">
    <h2>Before and After the Deputy Trustee/Clerk Position</h2>

    <p>
      The comparison below shows how township structure changed when the deputy/clerk position was no longer

        <h3>2012–2014<br /><span>With Deputy Trustee/Clerk</span></h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Staffing:</strong> Trustee, three board members, and a paid Deputy Trustee/Clerk.</li>
          <li><strong>Admin support:</strong> Day-to-day paperwork and records had a dedicated support role.</li>
          <li><strong>Public records:</strong> Additional capacity to help manage minutes, files, and assistance documentation.</li>
          <li><strong>Continuity:</strong> Easier to identify a deputy-level person who could assist if the trustee was unavailable.</li>
          <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Approximately $3,500–$4,000 per year for the deputy/clerk position.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="comparison-column">
        <h3>2015–Present<br /><span>No Deputy Position Reported</span></h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Staffing:</strong> Trustee and three board members; no deputy/clerk in compensation reports.</li>
          <li><strong>Admin support:</strong> Administrative duties handled by the trustee and/or others without a separately funded deputy.</li>
          <li><strong>Public records:</strong> Records and responses may depend on fewer people, which can work well or create strain.</li>
          <li><strong>Continuity:</strong> Public information alone does not clearly identify who would act as a deputy if the trustee could not serve.</li>
          <li><strong>Cost:</strong> No separate deputy/clerk salary, reducing direct personnel expense but also reducing dedicated admin capacity.</li>

    <h2>Leadership Continuity in Jackson Township</h2>
    <p>
      Jackson Township has experienced a high level of leadership continuity over the last decade. This section
      highlights how long certain offices have been held so residents can better understand who has guided
      township decisions and for how long. This information is presented for transparency only and is not
      criticism of any individual.
    </p>

    <div class="comparison-grid">
      <div class="comparison-column">
        <h3>Jeffrey W. Cook</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>2012–2014:</strong> Served as Township Trustee.</li>
          <li><strong>2015–Present:</strong> Serves as Advisory Board Member.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small">
          Combined, this represents over a decade of continuous influence on township budgets, tax levies,
          contracts, and financial oversight.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="comparison-column">
        <h3>Audra J. Wilcoxson</h3>

        </ul>
        <p class="small">
          This represents multiple four-year terms overseeing budgets, township assistance, administrative
          decisions, and township operations. Some residents value long-term continuity; others prefer periodic
          change and fresh perspectives.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="small">
      Highlighting service length helps residents understand how representation and oversight have evolved
      over time. It is up to the community to decide whether current levels of continuity meet their expectations.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="trustee-designee" class="card">
    <h2>Trustee Designee Requirement</h2>
    <p>
      Indiana law requires every township trustee to designate a person who will perform the trustee’s duties
      if the trustee becomes absent from the township or is incapacitated. This must be done within thirty days
      of taking office. The trustee is required to notify:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Chairman of the Township Board</li>
      <li>The County Sheriff</li>
      <li>Any other persons the trustee chooses</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The law does not say that the board chair automatically becomes the designee. The trustee must formally
      designate someone and provide official notice. The designee may or may not be a paid township official.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="designee-transparency" class="card">
    <h2>Trustee Designee Transparency</h2>
    <p>
      Because the law does not require the designee’s name to be publicly posted, the absence of a paid deputy
      or clerk does not prove that no designee exists. A trustee could fully comply with the law while designating
      an unpaid individual or someone who is not shown in compensation data.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Jackson Township does not currently publish:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The name of the current designee</li>
      <li>The date of the trustee’s designation notice</li>
      <li>Any updates or changes to the designee</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This means residents cannot independently verify who would perform the trustee’s duties during an
      unexpected absence or emergency. Even if the trustee has fully complied with legal requirements, the
      lack of public visibility creates uncertainty about continuity of operations.
    </p>
    <p class="small">
      A simple public posting of the trustee’s designee—without any additional cost—would demonstrate a strong
      commitment to transparency and give residents greater confidence in the township’s continuity plan.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="continuity-checklist" class="card">
    <h2>Continuity of Township Government Checklist</h2>
    <p>
      Residents can reasonably expect certain continuity-of-government items to be documented and available
      upon request. Examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Trustee’s Designee:</strong> Written designation naming who performs the trustee’s duties in
          case of absence or incapacity.</li>
      <li><strong>Notice Recipients:</strong> Confirmation that the Board Chair and County Sheriff were notified.</li>
      <li><strong>Organizational Structure:</strong> Clear explanation of who handles administration, assistance,
          recordkeeping, and budgeting.</li>
      <li><strong>Meeting Records:</strong> Agendas and minutes from township board meetings.</li>
      <li><strong>Appropriations and Contracts:</strong> Annual budget approvals, fire/EMS contracts, and
          assistance guidelines.</li>
      <li><strong>Public Contact Information:</strong> How residents can reach the trustee, board members, and
          township office.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small">
      Availability of this information strengthens community trust and helps ensure stability during emergencies
      or leadership changes.

  <section id="fire-contract-2026" class="card">
    <h2>Fire &amp; Emergency Services Contract Expiration (January 1, 2026)</h2>
    <p>
      Jackson Township’s current fire and emergency medical services contract is scheduled to expire on
      <strong>January 1, 2026</strong>. The Township Trustee is responsible for negotiating, securing, and
      executing agreements that ensure uninterrupted fire and emergency response for residents.
    </p>
    <p>
      In July 2025, the township published two public communications announcing changes to its fire service
      structure and its intention to strengthen or reorganize the volunteer fire department:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://jacksontownshipdekalb.com/2025/07/10/letter-to-jackson-township-residents/" target="_blank">
          Letter to Jackson Township Residents (July&nbsp;10,&nbsp;2025)
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://jacksontownshipdekalb.com/2025/07/11/press-release-jackson-township-strengthens-volunteer-fire-department-to-ensure-community-safety-and-independence/" target="_blank">
          Press Release: Strengthening the Volunteer Fire Department (July&nbsp;11,&nbsp;2025)
        </a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Since those announcements, no additional updates, meeting minutes, or contract details have been made
      publicly available regarding the 2026 fire/EMS plan. This does not imply inaction by township officials,
      but it does mean residents currently have no clear, public description of the next fire and emergency
      service arrangement.

      <li><strong>Mutual Aid:</strong> “What mutual aid agreements or backup plans exist if the primary department is unavailable or overwhelmed?”</li>
      <li><strong>Financial Impact:</strong> “How will the 2026 fire/EMS arrangement affect the township budget and tax rates, and has the Advisory Board reviewed those changes?”</li>
      <li><strong>Ongoing Communication:</strong> “How will residents be kept informed as decisions are made about fire and emergency services after 2025?”</li>
