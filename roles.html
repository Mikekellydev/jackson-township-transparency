          agreements that protect residents.</li>
      <li>The current contract is scheduled to expire on <strong>January 1, 2026</strong>.</li>

          community safety, not politics.</li>

<section id="fire-questions">
  <h3>Questions to Ask at the Next Public Meeting</h3>
  <p>
    If and when a township board meeting is held, residents may want to ask clear, respectful questions
    about fire and emergency services. Examples include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contract Status</strong><br>
        “What fire and EMS agreement will be in place on January 1, 2026, when the current contract expires?”</li>

    <li><strong>Service Level</strong><br>
        “Will response times, staffing levels, and equipment be equal to or better than what residents receive
        today?”</li>

    <li><strong>Volunteer Department Readiness</strong><br>
        “What specific steps have been completed to strengthen the volunteer fire department since the July 2025
        press release, and what remains to be done?”</li>

    <li><strong>Mutual Aid and Backup</strong><br>
        “What mutual aid agreements or backup plans are in place if the primary department is unavailable or
        overwhelmed?”</li>

    <li><strong>Financial Impact</strong><br>
        “How will the 2026 fire/EMS arrangement affect the township budget and tax rates, and has the Advisory
        Board reviewed and approved those changes?”</li>

    <li><strong>Communication Going Forward</strong><br>
        “How will the trustee and board keep residents informed as decisions are made about fire and emergency
        services after 2025?”</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="small">
    These questions are intended to help residents understand plans for community safety and continuity of
    service, not to criticize any individual.
